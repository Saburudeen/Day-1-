HTTP 1

*HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server.
* client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.
*This request uses the GET method, which asks for data from the host server listed after Host:. In response to this request website.
*web server returns an HTML page to the requesting client, in addition to any images, stylesheets, or other resources called for in the HTML. 
Note that not all of the resources are returned to the client in the first call for data.

HTTP 2

*HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of reducing web page 
load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization.
*many browsers supported this standardization effort, including Chrome, Opera, Internet Explorer.
*most significant features that distinguishes HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 is the binary framing layer.
*In HTTP/2, the binary framing layer encodes requests/responses and cuts them up into smaller packets of 
information, greatly increasing the flexibility of data transfer.
*establishes a single connection object between the two machines.
